\description{
\eqn{\alpha}-SVM.
}

\usage{
alfa.svm(y, x, a = seq(-1, 1, by = 0.1), cost = seq(0.2, 2, by = 0.2), gamma = NULL)

\arguments{
\item{y}{
The response variable, it can either be a factor (for classification) or a numeric vector (for regression).
Depending on the nature of the response variable the function will proceed with the necessary task.
}
\item{x}{
A matrix with the compositional data.
}
\item{a}{
A vector with a grid of values of the power transformation, it has to be
between -1 and 1. If zero values are present it has to be greater than 0.
If a=0, the isometric log-ratio transformation is applied.
}
\item{cost}{
A grid of values for the cost of constraints violation. The cost is the
"C"-constant of the regularization term in the Lagrange formulation.
}
\item{gamma}{
A grid of values for the \eqn{\gamma} parameter of the Gaussian kernel.
If no values are supplied the default grid is used, ten equidistant values
from \eqn{1/D^2} to \eqn{\sqrt{D}},
}
}

\details{
Cross validation is performed to select the optimal parameters for the SVM
and also estimate the rate of accuracy. For continuous responses the estimated
performance translates to the MSE, while for categorical responses (factors) this
is the accuracy (percentage of crrect classification).
}

\value{
A list including:
\item{mod}{
A list with the results of the SVM model for each value of \eqn{\alpha} that includes the SVM output (an svm class object) as provided by the function "svm" of the package \bold{e1071}, the configurations used (cost and gamma values) and the predicted values if the argument "xnew" is not NULL.
